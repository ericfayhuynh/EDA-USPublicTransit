The population density of a state has a positive correlation with the percentage of people who use public transportation. There is a higher percentage of public transportation users in more densely populated cities.

The number of registered vehicles in a state does not show a strong correlation, but there is a slight negative correlation. We cannot firmly establish a correlation between more registered vehicles and lower percentages of public transportation users.

There is a positive correlation between the percentage of individuals with access to cars and the percentage of people using public transportation. States with higher car access also have higher public transportation usage.

States with a higher percentage of people with a bachelor's degree or higher show a positive correlation with public transportation ridership. There is a stronger preference for public transportation in states with higher education levels.

The unemployment rate does not have a strong correlation, but there is a slight positive correlation with the percentage of people using public transportation. There is a higher percentage of public transportation usage in states with higher unemployment rates.


Overall, out of the 8 variables investigated in this exploratory data analytical project, I was able to find out 5 variables that have a significant correlation value with greater than .5 or less than -.5. They were density, % of people with bacelor's or higher, no access to cars, gross domestic per capita, and cars per houshold. Where cars per household was the only one that had a significant negative correlation and the rest were a significant positive correlation.
