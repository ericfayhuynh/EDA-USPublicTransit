# United States Public Transportation Usage - Exploratory Data Analysis Project

### Objective

The aim of my project is to improve the relevance and usage of public transportation systems in the United States. By analyzing various factors like ridership, service levels, and demographics, I aim to uncover challenges and propose solutions for enhancing public transportation.

### Summary
In this project, I engaged in data collection, cleaning, and analysis to answer specific research questions. For instance, I looked at how population density correlates with public transportation usage and whether having more registered vehicles in a state impacts public transportation negatively. I utilized Python libraries like Pandas for data manipulation, Matplotlib and Seaborn for data visualization, and Numpy and Scipy for numerical and statistical operations. I also integrated data from multiple sources, including APIs and various CSV files. These technical skills were crucial in deriving meaningful insights and patterns that could guide public transportation strategies.

### Tools/Libraries
- Excel
- Python
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- API
- Numpy
- Seaborn
- scipy




### Research Questions
1.  How does the population density of a state correlate with the percentage of people who use public transportation? Is there a higher percentage of public transportation users in more densely populated states?

1.  Does the availability of registered vehicles in a state have a negative correlation with public transportation ridership? In other words, do states with more registered vehicles have lower percentages of public transportation users?

1.  Is there a positive correlation between the percentage of individuals with access to cars and the percentage of people using public transportation? Do states with higher car access also have higher public transportation ridership due to the complementarity between the two modes of transportation?

1.  How does the level of education in a state (measured by the percentage of individuals with at least a bachelor's degree) correlate with public transportation ridership? Is there a stronger preference for public transportation in states with higher education levels?

1.  Does the unemployment rate in a state have any significant correlation with the percentage of people using public transportation? Are individuals more likely to rely on public transportation during periods of higher unemployment?
