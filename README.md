Project Description
  The goal of this project is to explore ways to enhance the relevance and usage of public transportation in the United States. The project will involve conducting an in-depth analysis of existing public transportation systems, identifying potential challenges, and proposing strategies to address them. The focus will be on improving accessibility, efficiency, and ridership to make public transportation a more attractive and viable option for commuters and the general public.
  The project will involve data collection, cleaning, and analysis using various datasets related to public transportation. These datasets may include information on ridership, service levels, routes, demographics, infrastructure, and other relevant factors. Data visualization techniques will be employed to effectively communicate insights and patterns derived from the analysis.
