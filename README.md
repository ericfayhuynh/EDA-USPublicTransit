Project Title

Enhancing Relevance and Ridership of Public Transportation in the United States: An Exploratory Data Analysis


Topic

  Public Transportation Enhancement


Question
1.  How does the population density of a state correlate with the percentage of people who use public transportation? Is there a higher percentage of public transportation users in more densely populated states?

2.  Does the availability of registered vehicles in a state have a negative correlation with public transportation ridership? In other words, do states with more registered vehicles have lower percentages of public transportation users?

3.  Is there a positive correlation between the percentage of individuals with access to cars and the percentage of people using public transportation? Do states with higher car access also have higher public transportation ridership due to the complementarity between the two modes of transportation?

4.  How does the level of education in a state (measured by the percentage of individuals with at least a bachelor's degree) correlate with public transportation ridership? Is there a stronger preference for public transportation in states with higher education levels?

5.  Does the unemployment rate in a state have any significant correlation with the percentage of people using public transportation? Are individuals more likely to rely on public transportation during periods of higher unemployment?

Project Description

  The goal of this project is to explore ways to enhance the relevance and usage of public transportation in the United States. The project will involve conducting an in-depth analysis of existing public transportation systems, identifying potential challenges, and proposing strategies to address them. The focus will be on improving accessibility, efficiency, and ridership to make public transportation a more attractive and viable option for commuters and the general public.
  The project will involve data collection, cleaning, and analysis using various datasets related to public transportation. These datasets may include information on ridership, service levels, routes, demographics, infrastructure, and other relevant factors. Data visualization techniques will be employed to effectively communicate insights and patterns derived from the analysis.
